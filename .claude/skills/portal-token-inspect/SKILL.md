description: Explain a 401, 403 or 404 of a portal module from the person's token, offline - decode the Portal IAM access token (without verifying it), check it the way the shared token library does (C2-M5 7.6 - RS256, iss of the installation, exp, aud portal-core, typ Bearer), and predict the answer of a given call from its x-permission and x-permission-scope (company, osp, own). Use for "why 401", "why 403 although I am Company Admin", "why 404 for a company that exists", "token of OSP B against OSP A", "which permission does this call need", "decode this token".

# Portal token inspect

Every call of a person carries their token from the OSP's Portal IAM (Keycloak, C2-M5). The module answers 401 when the
token fails the validation, 403 when the permission is missing, and 404 when the object belongs to another company or
person (FRAMEWORK 4.3: the object stays invisible). Three different causes, three different fixes.

```bash
T=.claude/skills/portal-token-inspect/scripts/token-inspect.py
uv run python iam/test/get-token.py erika > /tmp/erika.jwt        # service repo: a test person's token
$T /tmp/erika.jwt                                                  # claims + C2-M5 7.6 checks
$T /tmp/erika.jwt --op "GET /api/c3-m1/companies/c0000002-0000-4000-8000-000000000002"
$T /tmp/erika.jwt --op "POST /api/c1-m3/review-cases/{id}/approve" --iss http://localhost:8080/auth/realms/CX-Central
pbpaste | $T -                                                     # from stdin; a Keycloak token response works too
```

## Reading the result

| Answer | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 401 `unauthorized` | signature, `iss` (a token of another installation: OSP A realm `CX-Central`, OSP B `CX-Central-B` in the test IAM), `exp`, `aud` without `portal-core` (technical users and apps), `typ` | get a token from this installation's Portal IAM for the UI client |
| 403 `forbidden` | the permission (`x-permission`) is not in `resource_access.portal-core.roles` | the person's portal role does not bundle it (C2-M5 6.3); OSP staff roles are `OSP Reviewer`, `OSP Admin` |
| 404 `not-found` on scope `company` | `company_id` missing (account not bound yet) or another company | bind the account (onboarding, invitation); use the person's own company |
| 404 on scope `own` | the object belongs to another `sub` | each person sees only their own applications and notifications |

The script decodes only. It never verifies the signature and never calls Keycloak; the real check is
`portal_common.tokens`. Names are shown as "set". **Never paste a production token into an issue, PR or chat**: tokens
carry personal and company data (FRAMEWORK 4.6). Describe the claims instead.

## Requirements

python3 + PyYAML and the backend spec (for `--op`).
