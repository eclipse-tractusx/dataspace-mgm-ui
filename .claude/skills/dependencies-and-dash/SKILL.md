name: dependencies-and-dash
description: Run the Eclipse Dash license check of the Dataspace Management repositories exactly like the workflow .github/workflows/dependencies.yml, locally - the runtime dependencies from uv.lock (service) or package-lock.json (UI), the generated DEPENDENCIES file, restricted or rejected packages, and the IP review. Use for "I added a dependency", "Eclipse Dash IP Check fails", "DEPENDENCIES is out of date", "is this library allowed", "request an IP review", or before a PR that changes pyproject.toml, uv.lock, package.json or package-lock.json.

# Dependencies and Eclipse Dash

TRG 7.04: every third-party package must be listed in `DEPENDENCIES` and approved by the Eclipse Dash License Tool. CI
(`Eclipse Dash IP Check`) regenerates the file and fails when it differs or a package is `restricted` or `rejected`.
This script runs the same steps locally, so the PR does not fail on it.

```bash
D=.claude/skills/dependencies-and-dash/scripts/dash-check.sh
$D --list-only     # coordinates only: what is new or gone compared with DEPENDENCIES (no Java, no Dash APIs)
$D                 # Dash like CI: licences and status, restricted/rejected, diff with DEPENDENCIES
$D --write         # replace DEPENDENCIES with the generated file, then commit it
```

| Repository | Input (as in CI) | Coordinates |
|---|---|---|
| dataspace-mgm-service | `uv export --frozen --no-dev --no-hashes --no-emit-project` (runtime dependencies only) | `pypi/pypi/-/<name>/<version>` |
| dataspace-mgm-ui | `package-lock.json` read by Dash | `npm/npmjs/<scope or ->/<name>/<version>` |

The Dash version comes from `DASH_VERSION` in the workflow (default 1.1.0); the jar is cached in
`~/.cache/eclipse-dash`.

## When a package is restricted

1. `restricted` means "not yet reviewed", not "forbidden". Prefer a version that is already approved, if one is.
2. Otherwise a committer runs the workflow `Eclipse Dash IP Check` with `request_review` (it needs the secret
   `ECLIPSE_DASH_TOKEN`), or runs Dash with `-review -token …`. The review appears at
   https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/iplab/-/issues.
3. `rejected` means: remove the package.
4. Development tools (pytest, Vite, ESLint) are not in the runtime list of the service; the UI lock file lists all.

## Requirements

`git`, `bash`, `uv` (service) or `python3` (UI, for `--list-only`), Java 17+ and network access to
`repo.eclipse.org` and the Eclipse / ClearlyDefined APIs for a full run.
