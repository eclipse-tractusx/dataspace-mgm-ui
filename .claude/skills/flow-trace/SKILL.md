description: Trace the flows of Process Orchestration (C12-M1 flows.yaml) across the portal modules - onboarding, transfer, return, reactivation, deactivation, wallet access, app approval, subscriptions, connectors in the discovery. Use for "what happens after ApplicationApproved", "which module runs next", "why does the process wait", "which steps does C4-M2 take part in", "which flow does this event start", "where does the bpn input of assign-identifier come from", "is flows.yaml consistent with the specs", or to explain a process state the UI shows.

# Flow trace

Flows are data (FRAMEWORK 1): every step runs through Process Orchestration (C12-M1), modules only describe their
steps with preconditions, and an event moves the process on. This skill reads `flows.yaml` and joins it with the module
specs and the event catalogue, so a question like "why is my company still `REQUESTED`" gets an exact answer.

```bash
F=.claude/skills/flow-trace/scripts/flow-trace.py
$F list                         # 25 flows: trigger (with condition), subject, steps, early end
$F show onboarding              # step by step: module, condition, waitFor, completesOn/failsOn, every input source
$F module c3-m2                 # every step of C3-M2 in every flow, the lookups that query it, flows its events start
$F event ApplicationApproved    # which flows the event starts, unblocks, completes, fails or ends
$F check                        # flows.yaml against the specs, like C12-M1 at start-up (README 6.2); exit 1 on a problem
```

## How to read a flow

| Field | Meaning (C12-M1 README 6.1) |
|---|---|
| `trigger` | event (with `when` condition on its fields) that starts a process |
| `subject`, `correlateBy` | what the process is about; which field assigns later events to it |
| `when` on a step | the step runs only if the condition holds, otherwise `SKIPPED` |
| `waitFor` | the step waits for this event (e.g. the decision `ApplicationApproved`); no time limit |
| `completesOn` / `failsOn` | events that end a `RUNNING` (long-running) step; `set` adds process variables |
| `endOn` | events that end the process early, but only while a `waitFor` event is still open (6.5) |
| input sources | `name` process variable, `steps.<key>.<field>` earlier result, `lookup.<name>.<field>` query, `=VALUE` fixed |

## Diagnosing a stuck process

1. `show <flow>` and find the step: which module, which event it waits for or completes on.
2. A `waitFor` step waits for a human decision or a callback; a `completesOn` step waits for the module's own event.
   Check that the module published it with the exact name and the `correlateBy` field (`GET /scaffold/events` in the
   scaffold lists what was published).
3. An input with no source value is left out; if the step needs it, the step answers 400 and the run is `FAILED`
   (README 6.1). Follow the source back with `show`.
4. Retries: `retryable: true` errors are retried with back-off up to `maxAttempts`; `false` is final, OSP staff can
   retrigger (`POST /api/c12-m1/processes/{processId}/steps/{stepKey}/retrigger`, `retrigger_process_steps`).
5. In the UI, the process state arrives as SSE event `process-changed` (C12-M1 7.6 to 7.8); the UI never decides the
   next step itself.

## Requirements

Same as `portal-spec-sources` (python3 + PyYAML, the backend spec; `FLOWS_FILE` replaces flows.yaml like in the scaffold).
