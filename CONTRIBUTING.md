# Contributing to Eclipse Tractus-X

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The companies involved want to increase the automotive industry's
competitiveness, improve efficiency through industry-specific cooperation and
accelerate company processes through standardization and access to information
and data. A special focus is also on SMEs, whose active participation is of
central importance for the network's success. That is why Catena-X has been
conceived from the outset as an open network with solutions ready for SMEs,
where these companies will be able to participate quickly and with little IT
infrastructure investment. Tractus-X is meant to be the PoC project of the
Catena-X alliance focusing on parts traceability.

## How to contribute to the Dataspace Management

1. Sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](#eclipse-contributor-agreement) with the email address you use for your commits.
2. Open an issue, or comment on an existing one, before you start bigger changes, so that the committers can give early feedback.
3. Fork the repository, create a branch from `main` and open a pull request against `main`.
4. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for the PR title (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:` ...): the titles are used for the release notes.
5. Add the copyright and license header ([License headers](#license-headers), TRG 7.02) to every new file, and keep the documentation and the `CHANGELOG.md` up to date.
6. New third-party dependencies must be approved by the [Eclipse Dash License Tool](https://github.com/eclipse-dash/dash-licenses); the `DEPENDENCIES` file is checked on every pull request.
7. Pull requests with more than 1000 lines of relevant code need an approved [IP review](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-03) before they can be merged.

At least one committer has to approve a pull request before it is merged.

## License headers

Every new file starts with the copyright and license header of
[TRG 7.02](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/trg-7/trg-7-02). TypeScript, JavaScript and CSS:
